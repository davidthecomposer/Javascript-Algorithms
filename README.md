# Javascript-Algorithms
A collection of Javascript algorithms that I solved on my own. I will continue adding new ones as I finish and would like to also add notes to highlight important principles, mistakes or other points that might help me or others learn.

# A little bit about me
  My name is David Campbell,  I'm a new coder and composer who is passionate about both subjects. Take a look at my portfolio and my [music site](www.davidhalcampbell.com) to see more of my work.

 I'm currently available for exciting projects.
